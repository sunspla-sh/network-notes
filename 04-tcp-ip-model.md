# TCP/IP Model

## Overview

### What is the TCP/IP Model

- The TCP/IP Model is a reference model for computer networking and troubleshooting with 4 layers rather than the 7 layers of the OSI model

- Also known as the TCP/IP Stack or the DoD Model

- The TCP/IP Model is a predecessor of and alternative to the OSI Model, and also serves as the basis for most modern computer networks

- The 4 layers of the TCP/IP Model are listed below from top to bottom (highest to lowest layer):

    - Application Layer (Layer 4)
        - Equivalent to the Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model
    - Transport Layer (Layer 3)
        - Equivalent to the Transport layer of the OSI model
    - Internet Layer (Layer 2)
        - Equivalent to the Network layer of the OSI model
    - Network Interface Layer (Layer 1)
        - Equivalent to the Datalink and Physical layers of the OSI model

## Network Interface Layer (Layer 1)

### What is the Network Interface Layer?

- The Network Interface Layer describes how to transmit bits across a network and determines how the network medium is going to be used

## Internet Layer (Layer 2)

### What is the Internet Layer?

- The Internet Layer is where data is taken and packaged into IP datagrams

- Some protocol examples at this layer include the following:

    - IP
    - ICMP
    - ARP
    - Reverse ARP

## Transport Layer (Layer 3)

### What is the Transport Layer?

- The Transport Layer of the TCP/IP model is identical to the transport layer of the OSI model

- The Transport Layer defines the level of service and the status of the connection being used by TCP, UDP, RTP, or other layer 3 protocols

## Application Layer (Layer 4)

### What is the Application Layer?

- The Application Layer dictates how programs are going to interface with the transport layer by conducting session management

- Additionally, the Application Layer is where the user interacts with the network using some sort of program

- Some protocol examples at this layer include the following:

    - HTTP
    - Telnet
    - FTP
    - SSH
    - SNMP
    - DNS
    - SMTP
    - SSL/TLS
